 *             session scope, which is also what makes core dial the team
 *             store that scope belongs to.
 *   - `off` → the hook is silent and does nothing at all.
 *   - `ask` → the hook is silent, except the prompt-level inject hook of each
 *             editor, which on the first prompt of a session emits the one
 *             question built by {@link folderAskOnce} instead of memories.

 * Only the CLI (`plur folders set`) writes the map; nothing here writes it.
